Here's Robert Kiyosaki. Hello, hello, hello. Robert Kiyosaki, the Rich Dad Radio Show, the good news and bad news about money. And today we're talking about real money, not this garbage here, not this fake paper stuff. And for those who have paid attention to my program for all these years, you know, I just don't know why people work for this garbage. This is toilet paper. And we have an old time, longtime friend, Kevin DeMarrott. He's a founder of Lear Capital, one of the largest precious metal firms. And I don't think he understands either. Why do people hang with the toilet paper? I don't know. So our program today is to kind of break people away from the idea that this is money. But anyway, they printed more money and we never heard about it just recently. They printed so much more of this trash just to prevent the banks, because it was Silvergate and Silver Rattles. Banks were going down. They had to do something. So they basically took T-bills where everybody thinks are safe and they basically liquefied it. And now they're flooding the system more of this stuff. The reason I'm on this point here is because I get into a lot of fights with friends and family and people like that, and they want to hang on to this. They want to save this at the same time the Fed and the Treasury are printing trillions, trillions. And we're hanging on to it. But I am Japanese. I'm not a white supremacist, which I'm accused of being also. But also the Japanese are number one savers in the world. And what do they save? Yen and T-bills, US T-bills. I mean, Japanese maybe get admitted to Harvard and Princeton and Yale, but they don't know jack about money because they save yen. I would never save yen. I wouldn't even use yen as toilet paper. That's how bad it is. But the Japanese proudly save it and the government prints trillions of it. So again, we don't make any recommendations. This is your choice. Do your own research. We don't make any recommendations. We should buy this or buy that or invest in this or that. But I guess as Kevin demerit, we've been working together for years. It's Lear Capital. I got famous going because Kevin spent millions promoting me on all the financial networks. I'm going buy silver, buy silver. And my friends would come up and they say, you saying buy silver? I said, yeah, buy it. Did you buy any? No. Anyway, Kevin, we got the word out anyway, but people now thinking about it. And I think when you were telling, we were telling the world to buy silver, think silver was two bucks or something. And today 24 bucks. Yeah. People would have listened to you. This dollar has come down and these guys are still saving this toilet paper or yen or pesos or euro. Anyway, welcome to the program. Olfen, Kevin McDermott. Yeah. Great to be here, Robert. What do you think of my comment? Would you save the yen? No, I would save the US dollar. I wouldn't save the yen. I wouldn't save any paper currency at this point. They've been printing money so fast. You know, it seems to get worse and worse every year. And the dollar is going nowhere but down. No, and it's getting worse. I mean, just recently, I mean, within the last six months when Silverado and Silvergate, where those banks were, when they tried to stop inflation by raising interest rates, the bond markets collapsed. And when the bond markets collapse, so does the stock market collapse. And we have a baby boom generation. We're in serious trouble, serious trouble because they're saving paper, stocks bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, things I wouldn't touch. I mean, you can do it if you like. I don't have to because I own the physical asset. I own the mines. I own businesses. I'm an entrepreneur. But so many people are being set up, Kevin. Don't you think so? My generation, not so much yours, your generation still has time. Yeah, they are being set up. And really, you know, Robert, I look for tipping points. And the tipping point when they really started printing up a lot of money goes all the way back to the year 2000 when Alan Greenspan, after the dot com bubble, just started printing money like crazy. People don't understand, but we had five point six trillion dollars worth of debt in 2000. I mean, on balance sheet debt. And now we're at thirty three trillion. What happens to real money when that happens? If you go back to 2000, the gold market was trading at two hundred seventy five dollars an ounce. Silver was about three dollars and fifty dollars, three dollars and fifty cents an ounce. Two thousand silver is twenty five dollars an ounce. We've added so much paper money, it's making the value of tangible assets worth much, much more. So that's what people have to get wrapped around in their head. Every time they print more of this paper money, that becomes worth less and the tangible assets become worth more. And right now, the next hot new thing is that what's that AI, artificial intelligence? I did a talk at my friend Ken McElroy's event. Somebody said, what is AI? Is it a college degree? You don't learn anything about money. I mean, that was my poor dad, PhD. I kept saying PhD is for poor, helpless and desperate. Yeah, they'll be able to figure out how to invest and that's going to tell you how to invest. And then you go see a financial planner who is only rewarded by selling you paper. Yeah. The national planner will not recommend gold or silver because they got no commission from it. It's not correct. That's right. I mean, they don't want to recommend that, which is really sad because if we go back to 2000, you know, I always use this example and some people agree with the time period, some people don't. But I like using long term horizons. In 2000, if you would have invested one hundred thousand dollars in the stock market, forgetting about dividends here for a second, today that'd be worth about three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. If you had invested eighty thousand dollars in the stock market and twenty thousand dollars in the gold market, that's worth three hundred and eighty five thousand. You picked up sixty five thousand extra dollars in your bank account over that time period by investing just 20 percent in precious metals. Why? Because they print up more and more of the paper money, the fake money, and the tangible assets become worth more and more. I mean, look, you've lived it. You started this a long time ago with your education about real estate and precious metals. Those are tangible assets that are appreciated in value. You would have done very well by owning those and gotten away from that paper dollar. Right. I'll just say I don't trust anything they can print. I mean, it's that simple. I own oil. I don't own, you know, standard oil or Exxon. I own the oil and the ground. I don't want anything they can print. But that's me. But that's what Rich Dads stands for. You know, we don't recommend going to college and getting a college degree and then your Ph.D. and then look for a job. Oh my God. Especially today because, you know, I've been listening to records and what's happening with AI. Unemployment is about to go through the roof. You know, records is calling for tens of thousands of people to be laid off simply because the economy is sliding into a recession, possible depression. And all the manufacturing companies throughout Europe and all that, they don't have jobs. They don't have any work coming in. And China, you know, China didn't save the economy. So here we are in August and July of 2023. And people are still going to school, looking for a job, saving money, putting the money in a 401K full of 401Ks and IRAs and all this other mutual funds and ETFs. Anything you can print, I don't want to trust. But that's me. I'm not recommending you do what I do. But that's why all these years I've been on Kevin's program saying buy silver. And of course, I said, I bought silver. No, they hang on to that yen. Oh, yeah. They love that paper dollar. It makes them feel rich when you can look at it in your bank account. Really, I think that's the allure of everything. Hey, I see how much money is in my bank account. It's absolutely doing nothing. First, you weren't getting any interest. Now you're getting a little interest that's still below the rate of inflation. So it's not helping anyone at all. And, you know, like I said, your education for people is so important, especially now with this AI and how much money is getting printed, that people really should start listening here. And how many people will lose their jobs in a few more years? I mean, it's going to be a massive. It's massive. I think it's going to be massive. And I'm just looking at our office building here, Robert. And about 25 percent of the building is completely empty. I just re-signed my lease for the same amount of money in my lease per square foot that I signed eight years ago. They had to do that because any more people leave this building, the bank won't even refinance their loan going forward. So, you know, they're just forced into lower and lower lease rates. But that gives you some sort of an idea. 25 percent of a building in the middle of Los Angeles is completely empty and they can't fill it up. Well, they're all moving to Arizona. That's why. I mean, I have any Kevin, I got the I saw the light about 30 years ago when California tried to tax my worldwide income. And people don't know what that means because they don't have worldwide income. But if you're an entrepreneur, I have income coming from all over the world. And so they want to take all of that. Adios. And we left. Oh, sure. Hey, not only that, if you leave the state, they want to keep taxing you after you leave the state. Oh, yeah. It's not a tax friendly state at all. And I was looking at the homeless problem. And, you know, I'm not Republican or Democrat. Trump and I wrote two books together. He's a good friend. But the thing that is amazing, this guy Biden opens, Trump puts up a wall and Biden tears it down and fentanyl pours across the border. And you wonder, why is homelessness going up? I said, most of those homeless guys, I mean, that's they're just on drugs. I mean, it's just a drug bazaar. And this guy, this Biden family, they can't find his son's laptop. The FBI had their hands on it. What's going on, Kevin? Well, you know, the funny one is, you know, probably the White House has to be the most secure house in the entire world. And somebody shows up with cocaine and they can't figure out who that was. I know. And what's funny, they got that little baggie of cocaine. Who brought it? I don't know. You know, the most secure house in the entire world. They can't figure out who brought it in. And nobody dusted it for prints. When you think about this, we must be in sci-fi or someplace where we went a bad movie. Right, Kevin? Oh, yeah, it is a bad movie. And, you know, this money printing is going to continue. And the government has no choice but to print money. There's absolutely no choice but to print money. That's all they know how to do. Well, it's not only, it's not only... They don't know how to make money. They're not attacked. Right, Robert. It's not only do they not know anything else to do, but I'll give you an example. We'll have a fun game here, right? Approve to people you can't stop printing money as the United States or basically any other country. So you and I live on an island and you're the banker because you're a smart guy and you have all the money. And that money is 10 shells. So the whole island's money supply is these 10 shells. And I come to you and I said, Robert, I have this incredible entrepreneurial idea. You look at me and you say, that is unbelievable. I will loan you the 10 shells at 10% interest. I take those 10 shells. I spend it to start my business. At the end of the year, I get all 10 shells back. And I come and I give them back to you and you put me out of business. Why? Because there isn't an 11th shell to pay you the interest. You as the banker have to print it up out of thin air so that I have the interest to pay you. That is what the government does in banking. They have to print more money. So that piece of paper that you keep holding up is absolutely worthless. It's going to get more and more worthless over time because you can't stop printing money. Yes, but you should save money. Save money. Every dollar they print, that shell just became worth less and less and less. That's where we're headed. People don't understand. We're going to pay you 3% interest. Inflation is running at 6%. I mean, can you do the math? Let's say I'm getting 3% interest, let's say, and it's running at 6% inflation. What's wrong with the math? Well, I'm happy I'm only going broke slowly. That's the problem with people. I can't believe how stupid people are. I mean, I really mean that. The CPI index is all messed up, so that doesn't even calculate things like that. We don't use those words here. CPI is consumer price inflation, basically. So we come back, we'll be going more into what I'm going to ask Kevin to talk about how he founded Lair Capital. Like I said, for full disclosure, I was a spokesperson for years. I got famous being on CNBC. Oh, by the way, I'll be on CNBC this Friday. Guess what I'm pitching? Gold and silver. I never saw that. I really would. Anyway, this Friday, this program will not be released yet. But I've been pitching gold and silver from Kevin de Merit and Lair Capital for years. Because, ladies and gentlemen, this is toilet paper. And it's becoming more and more toilet paper every single day. We'll be right back. Welcome back, Robert Kiyosaki, the Rich Dad Radio Show. The good news and bad news about this paper trash here. Cash. And, again, we don't make any recommendations. We ask you to do your own due diligence, study, find out. We're talking about my favorite subject, gold and silver. And for full disclosure, I own gold mines and silver mines. And I own oil wells. I don't own any paper stocks. I just don't trust the government or I don't trust Wall Street. And I definitely don't trust the Federal Reserve Bank. So the Rich Dad program is archived at richdadradio.com. We've archived it at richdadradio.com for one big reason. If you have friends, family, and cousins or relatives or that stupid neighbor down the street who is still saving trash, you know, pull up this program with Kevin Demarit and Lair Capital and discuss the subject of is this money? Is this trash? Is this fake? And are you going broke saving money? And, again, as at richdadradio.com, get together with friends and family and discuss it. Like I said, my family is, you know, we're fourth generation Japanese, but we still act Japanese. We still save money. And I talked to my brothers and sisters and they think, well, I'm going to save this. And I started this whole program to Kevin said, would you save the yen? But that's what the Japanese are doing. And the Mexicans are saving pesos. The Europeans are saving euros and the U.S. are saving U.S. dollars. That's how stupid people are when it comes to money. And as I've always asked people, what does school teach you about money? The answer is nothing. And that was not a mistake. So I guess today is Kevin Demarit and for full disclosure, like I've been a spokesperson for Lair Capital for years. I got to be people. So I know I know by silver, but they never bought silver. I'd ask them later on, Kevin. Anyway, tell us tell us a little bit about Lair Capital, how you found that and all that. Yeah, you know, it's interesting. I was actually in international banking. So we would establish banks in different jurisdictions for import, exportation companies, large big companies. And one day somebody says, hey, look, we've got to hedge all these different currencies when we capitalize these banks. Why don't we capitalize some of the banks with precious metals? And they put me in charge at 21 years old to go figure out if gold was a good idea. And after about nine months of research, I said, not only is it a good idea, but I'm leaving and going and starting a gold company because I think that's where people invest. So I got out of banking, started Lair and that's what I've done ever since. What year was that, Kevin? Well, I started Lair in 1997, but in 1990 is when I started a different company with a partner. And then, you know, I moved on and moved on with my own company in 97. So it was 1991 when I started in the gold industry. What was the price of gold and silver in 1991? It was about $325 and bounced around $325, $350 an ounce. I came down to a low of $255 in 2000 and then it's been up ever since. It all went down to 200 something. Yeah. Around 1990. Yep. And what's it at today? Almost 2000, 1957. And then this here is a silver buffalo. It's about an ounce. What was this in 1991 silver? 1991 silver was about $3.75 an ounce, got down to $2.75 an ounce. That's when Warren Buffett purchased a bunch of, you know, the silver. And then here we are at $25 an ounce. So had a pretty good run. And I still say to people, you know, I talked to, I mean, I talked to everybody about gold and silver because I don't save dollars. When I have extra money, I buy gold and silver and I keep it in a vault far away from my home. You know, you don't, I had a friend who stood on, stood on, stood on stage with me. He says, yeah, I buy gold and silver and I keep it in my home. I said, why don't you just invite everybody over? I mean, you never, never keep it at home, right? Oh, no, no, never keep it at home. Yeah. I got some crazy stories. There was a guy that, you know, purchased a fair amount of gold and silver and fairly wealthy guy and goes on vacation and had a floor safe. And his kid showed his next door neighbor friend the floor safe. And when they came back, there was a jackhammer halfway through getting the safe out of the ground. And they called who rented the jackhammer. It was the kid, the next door neighbor. So, yeah, I probably wouldn't keep it at home. There's all sorts of crazy stories that I could give about keeping it at home. So anyway, go back to the story of the, on the desert island with the shells. I mean, what happens after that? Well, look, you know, you're on an island with these 10 shells and you loan me those 10 shells. You can't, there's only 10 shells, right? That's the money that was on the island. And you lend it to me with 10% interest. I can't pay you back unless you, the banker prints up another shell for me so that I can get that shell. It's impossible for the government not to print more money each and every year. So if you think that dollar is going to become worth more, you would have to believe that the government's going to stop printing money. They stop printing money. The economy collapses, right? Paper money is going to get worth less and less. And I'm going to tell you something. I think the central banks have been listening to your program last year because the central banks last year purchased 25% of all of the gold mined last year. Think about this. They can print money and take that printed money that they printed out of thin air and they went and bought 25% of the 1250 metric tons of gold central banks purchased last year. They don't even trust their own money. No, of course not. And then recently this, this is what people do not understand is when the debt ceiling was at 30 trillion or some ungodly amount of number, a trillion seconds is 32,000 years. Think about that. And they had 30 trillion. That was 31 trillion. But that's, that's, that's the debt they record. That's also off balance sheet debt, which is estimated. That is almost twice as big as the on balance sheet debt, because if you add it all together, we're at a hundred trillion dollars. So if you had the social security and pensions and Medicare and Medicaid and all the off balance sheet liabilities, our debt is much, much bigger. However, as more and more people retire, that debt will start to be coming on balance sheet debt because we're going to have to borrow the money to pay those people. And then it switches over to the other side of the equation. So it's a scary situation and how far the dollar could fall if that happens. And there's one more thing happens. I'm pretty, I wrote a book called Who Stole My Pension and our pensions are bankrupt. And then we're going to do it. My company's doing a whole talk on Thursday with it. I keep my company educated about what's happening in the world. But on August 22nd, 2023 of this year in South Johannesburg, South Africa, the BRICS nations are meeting. BRICS stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa. Kevin, what does that meeting mean to you? The BRICS nation in Johannesburg, South Africa, 22 August, 2023? What it means to me is that if they create this currency backed by gold, Robert, this will be the largest transfer of wealth between nations we will ever see in the history of money. Right. And the BRICS, let me say one thing. The BRICS was just five nations a while ago. They estimate by the time the meeting comes in, there may be 41 nations. That's correct. But I'm going to give people an indication right now. Let me finish. They're so pissed off that the United States ripping us off paying fake money. Even the BRICS nations are pissed off. But Americans? No, we have no idea. But the BRICS are pissed. And so they're going to join up and they're going to say, we're not going to take your piece of toilet paper anymore. What does that mean, Kevin? Well, two things. I want to go back. Those five countries, OK, people don't understand. You said it, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. That's 40% of the population of the world. 3.2 billion people is 40% of the population. Just those five countries. You start adding in more countries. Where's the tipping point? You get to 50% or 60% of the people, the dollar's gone. But here's what it means to me with the transfer of wealth. Let's forget about the fact that there's a little bit of paper in this BRIC currency and we just use gold. OK, I came from international banking, which you just asked me about. So I understand trade very well. The United States has almost, last year, a $960 billion trade deficit. If we were dealing just in gold, we were trading gold back and forth, I would have sent $960 billion extra dollars to a country that sent me toys, clothes, cars, everything that depreciates, and they ended up with almost a trillion dollars worth of gold. So what happens to that currency? To have that currency, you need to back it by gold. That means there's going to be some gold demand, which probably pushes up the price of gold. It's backed by gold. It pushes up the value of that currency and it pushes down the value of the dollar. So my deficit keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and I keep throwing more and more gold over to them, and I have less. When it's paper dollars, nobody gets it. But you turn it into gold or let's say I was trading real estate. Heck, the whole real estate market in the United States is worth $70 trillion. If I give a trillion dollars to a different country of our real estate, that's one and a half percent of our real estate. In six years, I've given 10 percent of our real estate away. That's what it means. But the good news is the Barbie movie is coming out and they're going to sell a lot more Barbie dolls, you know, from China. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Which will push up the trade deficit. Yeah, we paid a trillion extra for Barbie dolls and we gave them gold for Barbie dolls. You know, it's crazy. It will be the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of nations if this thing goes through. The dollar, I heard you say it, the dollar gets repatriated back into the United States and inflation goes through the roof because paper means nothing. That gold backed currency will be where everybody goes, including how we need to purchase that to now have trade with those other countries. We're basically purchasing gold and throwing it back to them. Well, how much you think Barbie doll would be worth next year? Probably more than a dollar. Kevin, you know, for you and I, that's how ridiculous it is. Yeah, we could trade in Barbie. I mean, I don't want to buy Barbie dolls. Probably cost the same amount as the silver here. I'd rather have this, but they have the Barbie doll. You know what I mean? Screw it up, people. Anyway, we're running out of time. I want to talk to you about people can say, I don't save cash because I use debt to buy real estate. I use 100% debt financing. I don't recommend it. That's what I do. When the cash comes in, I converted to gold and silver and it's stored as far away as Switzerland. You know, I don't want anybody near my gold or silver. And I own I own took a gold gold company public last summer and from Utah and I will silver mine in Argentina. So I'm pretty hardcore in this whole thing. But my question is for the person just starting out, if they have what's called an IRA individual retirement account, how can you support the person starting out with an IRA? Yeah, that's a great question. You know, we're authorized to place gold and silver in an IRA through a custodian called Equity Trust. And so you can take a portion of your IRA or start an IRA and move that over to physical gold and silver. That's going to be stored at Delaware Depository. That's one of the largest depositories in the country. We've worked with them for over 15 years. And so now you have physical gold and silver, and if you ever want to take physical possession of that gold and silver through this specific IRA, you're able to do that. A lot of gold and silver IRAs, you're not able to do that. You have to sell it and take the cash and then go rebuy the precious metals. This custodian will actually deliver the physical metals to you. So that's why we work with them. OK, and then does a person have to be a U.S. citizen to have an IRA in America? Yes, they do, unfortunately. Well, the reason I ask that question is we have so many people that listen to the Rich Dad Radio show outside this country. So again, we don't make, this is Rich Dad, we don't make recommendations. I tell you what I do. I don't say you should do it. Like most people should have a 401k or in Canada it's called an RRSP. In Japan it's called a 401k. They copy everything we do like idiots. But I mean, if you're going to, I would, I recommend, you got to check it out for yourself. I don't save cash. I save gold and silver, tangible, real. I don't have any paper gold or silver. I have no ETF. You can buy a silver ETF, it's under SLV and gold ETF is GLV. That's paper gold and paper silver. Do you have any comments, Kevin, we're closing right now about person saving gold paper, GLD or SLV ETFs? Yeah, you know, that would be like you, you know, someone giving us a phone call and I said, Hey, look, I'll, I'll, I'll sell you the gold. And then I'm going to deliver 80% of it over to HSBC Bank and in, you know, Hong Kong or over in Great Britain. That's where it's going to be held. But it's not 100% in gold. Would you do it? Most people would say no. Okay. Well then why are you doing a GLD or SLV? You're not getting 100% backing of gold and it's held somewhere else that you could never get ahold of it. I don't think anybody would really want to do that if they thought about it long enough. Yeah. And again, we don't make recommendations, but what does the word hypothecation mean to you? Hypothecation? I see you understand what Kevin's laughing. I'll say it because I don't want to get him in trouble. I don't have a license. He has a license. Hypothecation means you buy this thing at a piece of paper and they'll sell it 10 different times. They'll just keep selling the same piece of crap silver paper, 10, 20, 30 times. So what happens if a person wants their money back at the same time, which is what might happen with the BRICS Nation August 22nd this year, there won't be any gold or silver there. That's the possibility. I don't want Kevin to say it because he'll get in trouble. It's a futures and options market. They're selling gold and silver they don't have. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank Kevin de Merit, Laird Capital. How can they contact you Kevin to find out about your IRA plan or any plan? If they give us a call 1-800-511-1960, it's 800-511-1960. Give us a phone call. We got a free special report on silver, another canceled report about the dollar. And for your listeners only, I want to do something special Robert. We're going to include a credit in their account of $250, which will cover their IRA costs or shipping costs on the metal. So we're going to do that free of charge. 800-511-1960. And I really appreciate you and all the education. Hey Kevin, it's been, it's been a really, I guess all these years, but when you and I started out, we were the lone wolves in the wilderness. Everybody hated us. Yeah. I know. Oh, you say buy silver. I go, yeah, it's only three bucks. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And they wish they bought some now. Anyway, my friend, thank you. Good luck to you. Laird Capital number one more time. 1-800-511-1960. Please, please call them. Just check it out. Doesn't cost anything. Just talk it over and find out if it works for you. So thank you all very much. And we come back with a final word from Rich Dad Radio. So we will wrap up here. Kevin, thanks a lot. Good luck to you. Thanks for having me Robert. Welcome back Robert Kiyosaki, the Rich Dad Radio show. We have the good news and bad news about this piece of trash here called the US dollar or yen or peso or euro or looney, whatever you guys traded. So my final words here, I thank Kevin de Merida of Laird Capital. I've been a full disclosure. I've been a spokesperson for them for years and years and years and years, and I don't do it for the money. I don't get paid a damn thing for it. I just want people to start saving gold and silver, not dollars, because they're going to print more and more and more of it as the debt gets bigger and the economy goes into a downturn. And as I said, my friend Jim records who also recommends gold, Jim Brookings is calling gold to go to 15,000 an ounce today. It's about 2000. So he's got a ways to go yet. But anyway, ladies and gentlemen, a lot of people who are in the know don't trust the dollar. They don't trust the Federal Reserve Bank. They don't trust the Treasury and they don't trust Wall Street. If you do keep saving this toilet paper. So, Sandra, what did you think? Listen to this. Well, I'm starting to feel a little bit fooled or foolish listening to this because fooled by the centralized bank system. I had no idea that they bought any kind of gold. And that's that was my huge eye opening moment of this show. They save gold. Yeah, I had no idea. Well, they don't teach you that in school anyway. Yeah. You know, what does a school teacher know about money? Nothing. Yeah. So, I mean, that was really that was a huge eye opener for me. But what do you think they can sell that gold over and over and over again, as long as in paper form? It's called hypothecation and re-hypothecation. Yeah, again, I feel fooled. Yeah, it's a game. So what are you going to do with something different? I mean, you can still buy a silver coin here for about thirty five bucks. You know, when it goes to one hundred and fifty, you can say it's too expensive now. Right. No, one hundred percent. Yeah. And, you know, also Kevin was talking about how you could take a portion of your IRA and acquire gold and silver. So those are those are some. Yeah. And the most important gold and silver is don't start in your house, store it far away from you. Again, we make no recommendations. We just say, check it out for yourselves. So I thank you all, ladies and gentlemen, for listening to the Rich Dad Radio Show. The song is the same. I don't trust the US dollar. And anyway, good luck to all of you.
